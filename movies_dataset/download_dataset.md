Download the `movie.csv` and the `rating.csv` files in the shared folder above. If the download time takes long, try downloading the ZIP file `movies_dataset.zip`, which contains the two files, and extract them locally.

Place the CSV files in a location of your choosing (tip: save in this current folder, alongside the `movies_exercise.ipynb`).
